Voter ID restrictions disproportionately affect young voters (who may not have state ID or licenses yet), older voters, minorities and Native voters.

If you go to vote and find you\u2019ve been purged, you can call the ACLU\u2019s election protection hotline (1-866-Our-Vote) and/or your local elections official, and then ask for a provisional ballot. Make sure you do that before getting frustrated and leaving.</p><p>Another strategy used to suppress the vote is <strong>cutting the early voting period</strong>, which gives people flexibility to vote when they can.\u201c<a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/23/politics/ohio-golden-week-early-voting/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Ohio</strong></a> cut a whole week from early voting, eliminating the \u2018golden week\u2019 in which voters could register and vote<strong>\u00a0</strong>on the same day,\u201d Vox reports. \u201cAnd <strong>Nebraska</strong> cut its early voting period from 35 days to no more than 30 days.\u201d (Emphasis theirs.)</p><div><div><div><p><small>Advertisement</small></p><div data-ad-unit=\"MOBILE_IN_POST\" data-targeting=\"{&quot;pos&quot;:&quot;mobile_inpost&quot;}\"></div><p></p></div></div></div><p>Finally, southern states are <strong>closing down polling locations</strong> in predominantly minority areas. \u201cIn the five years since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down key parts of the Voting Rights Act, nearly a thousand polling places have been shuttered across the country, many of them in southern black communities,\u201d writes <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2018/09/04/polling-places-remain-a-target-ahead-of-november-elections\" target=\"_blank\">Pew</a>, particularly, again, in Georgia, where Stacey Abrams, a black progressive woman, is running for governor.

The mailers, sent by Mayor Bill de Blasio, were reportedly \u201cso confusing and inaccurate that many voters thought they had been scammed by someone looking to suppress turnout in the midterm elections,\u201d writes the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-pol-deblasio-democracy-officer-inactive-voters-boe-20181016-story.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>New York Daily News</em></a>, leading to 1,600 calls to the Board of Elections.</p><div><div><div><p><small>Advertisement</small></p><div data-ad-unit=\"MOBILE_IN_POST\" data-targeting=\"{&quot;pos&quot;:&quot;mobile_inpost&quot;}\"></div><p></p></div></div></div><p>He\u2019s not the only pol who has sent misleading mail. The re-election campaign for Rep. Lee Zeldin, a Republican Congressman from New York, \u201cadmitted it mailed out information that gave voters the wrong deadline to return absentee ballots,\u201d reports the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/gop-congressman-sent-out-incorrect-information-on-absentee-ballot-deadline\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Washington Examiner</em></a>. It then said it mailed out new fliers with the correct information.</p><p>Mailing inaccurate or confusing information suppresses voter turnout for a number of reasons: Either because, in the case of Zeldin\u2019s mailers, voters don\u2019t know the correct deadlines, or because they might falsely believe they\u2019re no longer registered to vote. Mailers often have important information on them, so you don\u2019t want to ignore them\u2014but double check deadlines and your polling location before you go to vote. </p><h3>Misinformation on Social Media</h3><p>Mailers are one component of misinformation campaigns; social media is a bigger, more insidious threat. One example of why, as reported by <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://foxillinois.com/news/local/dont-fall-victim-to-possible-voter-suppression-scam-10-29-2018\" target=\"_blank\">Illinois\u2019s Fox affiliate</a>: In 2016, the Illinois board of elections warned that \u201cthe FBI detected text messages and social media campaigns that claimed to offer users the opportunity to vote electronically or promoted incorrect information about voting.\u201d </p><div><div><div><p><small>Advertisement</small></p><div data-ad-unit=\"MOBILE_IN_POST\" data-targeting=\"{&quot;pos&quot;:&quot;mobile_inpost&quot;}\"></div><p></p></div></div></div><p>Posts like this, which promoted false information, circulated during the 2016 election: </p><p><span class=\"twitter-embed\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" src=\"https://kinja.com/ajax/inset/iframe?id=twitter-788026963382468608&autosize=1\" width=\"500\" height=\"159\"></iframe></span></p><p>You cannot vote online anywhere in the U.S., you must vote in person or via absentee ballot. Here\u2019s <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.vote.org/polling-place-locator/\" target=\"_blank\">how to find your polling site</a>. Again, social media can be a great place to find relevant information, which is also what makes it the ideal place to spread misinformation. Make sure you look for proper sourcing on claims\u2014particularly ones that claim \u201cno one knows\u201d about them\u2014and check the ACLU\u2019s voting website or another voting nonprofit\u2019s for the correct information. </p><h3>Identity Theft</h3><p>It\u2019s not just political actors that voters need to watch out for; identity thieves also take advantage of America\u2019s confusing and laborious registration process. For example, in New York, some residents reported a call asking for personal information over the phone under the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-cautions-new-yorkers-voter-registration-scam\" target=\"_blank\">guise of voter registration</a>. But you cannot register to vote or vote over the phone or via text in the U.S.</p><div><div><div><p><small>Advertisement</small></p><div data-ad-unit=\"MOBILE_IN_POST\" data-targeting=\"{&quot;pos&quot;:&quot;mobile_inpost&quot;}\"></div><p></p></div></div></div><p>The <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2008/08/ftc-cautions-consumers-about-voter-registration-scams\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Trade Commission warned</a> against these scams back in 2008. \u201cScammers may send messages asking for your Social Security number or financial information supposedly to register you to vote \u2013 or to confirm your registration \u2013 when they really want to commit identity theft.\u201d</p><p>Additionally, \u201ccon artists pose as political volunteers in an attempt to lure voters into donating money by asking for cash or a credit card number,\u201d <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.aarp.org/politics-society/government-elections/info-2018/midterm-election-scams.html\" target=\"_blank\">warns the AARP</a>. \u201cExperts say these communications should be considered suspicious, and they urge consumers not to answer numbers they do not recognize.\u201d The AARP notes that \u201cthe Deep South, Washington, D.C., and states such as Michigan and Texas\u201d are especially common targets because voters are more passionate. Legitimate volunteers may call you, but it\u2019s unlikely that they\u2019ll kick off the call asking for money. If you do pick up the phone and a person asks for donations or other personal information, hang up. Even if the call is legitimate, it\u2019s better to go to the campaign\u2019s website and donate than to hand out your information over the phone.</p><h3>Threats and Intimidation </h3><p>In Dallas County, Texas, the county\u2019s nonpartisan election administrator says that voter harassment, such as name-calling and aggressive questions \u201cis the worst she\u2019s seen in decades,\u201d according to <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/reports-of-voter-intimidation-at-polling-places-in-texas\" target=\"_blank\">ProPublica</a>:</p><blockquote><p> At the Lakeside Activity Center in Mesquite, Texas, election administrators received complaints of a partisan poll watcher looking over voter\u2019s shoulders as they cast their ballots and questioning voters on their politics. The person was later escorted out by Mesquite Police Department officers on Monday after refusing to leave the premises.</p></blockquote><p>These types of tactics could make voters nervous. \u201cIf you are a first time voter\u2014say a young voter or a minority voter, a newly enfranchised Hispanic citizen voting for the first time\u2014and you have some aggressive white guy yelling at you as you walk in, it might have a negative effect,\u201d Calvin Jillson, a professor of political science at Southern Methodist University, told ProPublica. \u201cIt\u2019s meant to dissuade people from voting.\u201d</p><div><div><div><p><small>Advertisement</small></p><div data-ad-unit=\"MOBILE_IN_POST\" data-targeting=\"{&quot;pos&quot;:&quot;mobile_inpost&quot;}\"></div><p></p></div></div></div><p>Also note that most states ban political messaging within 100 feet of a polling station, and campaigning of any kind (including wearing a candidate\u2019s campaign t-shirt or button, for example). </p><p>But, according to the ACLU\u2019s Ebenstein, voters shouldn\u2019t be too worried about harassment or intimidation at the polls. \u201cIt\u2019s not common,\u201d she says.

This made scientists wonder whether birds evolved colored eggs on their own, or whether they inherited egg color from an ancient ancestor. A new analysis finds that egg color seems to have evolved only once, and that birds maintain this trait from their theropod days.<br></p><div><div><div><p><small>Advertisement</small></p><div data-ad-unit=\"MOBILE_IN_POST\" data-targeting=\"{&quot;pos&quot;:&quot;mobile_inpost&quot;}\"></div><p></p></div></div></div><p>\u201cHere, we\u2019re able to show just another case that a lot of characteristics unique to birds have their roots much deeper in dinosaur history,\u201d Mark Norell, division chair of paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History, told Gizmodo. </p><p>Researchers <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://gizmodo.com/these-dinosaurs-had-colorful-eggs-just-like-birds-1818543625\">previously found</a> evidence that oviraptor dinosaurs had pigment in their eggs just like birds do. They discovered this by slicing off a piece of a dinosaur egg and putting it through a molecule-identifying mass spectrometer machine. But for this recent study, two of the researchers from the first paper, along with Norell, hoped to analyze far more samples, so they needed a method that didn\u2019t require harming the fossils. </p><div data-ad-unit=\"SPLASHYMID\" data-targeting=\"{&quot;pos&quot;:&quot;splashymid&quot;}\"></div><div></div><p>\u201cThe method was the key to the whole paper,\u201d Jasmina Wiemann, Yale graduate student, told Gizmodo. </p><div><div><div><p><small>Advertisement</small></p><div data-ad-unit=\"MOBILE_IN_POST\" data-targeting=\"{&quot;pos&quot;:&quot;mobile_inpost&quot;}\"></div><p></p></div></div></div><p>The team sampled 19 eggshells from archosaurs, the group that includes crocodilians and dinosaurs, both extinct and living (including chickens). Rather than sampling pieces of the eggs, they used Raman spectroscopy\u2014hitting the samples with a laser and detecting the wavelengths of the light that bounces back. The colors of the scattered light reveal the kinds of molecules present in the eggs.<br></p><p>Both pigments found in today\u2019s bird eggs, red-brown protoporphyrin IX and blue-green biliverdin, also occurred in theropod eggs (direct bird ancestors), which had spotted and speckled patterns like bird eggs do. Pigment did not occur in the crocodilian, sauropod, or ornithischian eggs (the other two dinosaur groups), according to the study <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0646-5\" target=\"_blank\">published in Nature.</a> By mapping the distribution of egg color onto the evolutionary tree and determining which eggs were colored and which weren\u2019t. the researchers found their data supported the hypothesis that egg color evolved only once.</p><p>But why? Wiemann and Norell both hypothesized that the emergence of egg color stemmed from theropods no longer laying their eggs in underground or covered nests. An open nest meant that eggs that blended in had a better shot of surviving than stark white eggs did\u2014or in other cases, perhaps theropods needed to recognize their own eggs in case another animal sneakily laid an egg in the nest. One animal coloration expert not involved in the study, professor Mary Caswell Stoddard at Princeton, thought the research would ignite conversations about dinosaur behavior.</p><div><div><div><p><small>Advertisement</small></p><div data-ad-unit=\"MOBILE_IN_POST\" data-targeting=\"{&quot;pos&quot;:&quot;mobile_inpost&quot;}\"></div><p></p></div></div></div><p>\u201cThe exciting discovery that pigmented eggshells evolved in nonavian theropod dinosaurs will change the way we think about dinosaur nesting and incubation behavior,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat were the functions of diverse eggshell colors and patterns? Were they for camouflage? Thermoregulation? Or, as in some parasitic birds, to mimic the appearance of a host\u2019s eggs? These are just a few of the questions behavioral ecologists and paleontologists will be asking in the years to come.\u201d<br></p><p>This is also what Wiemann hopes to research next\u2014which theropods had colored eggs and which didn\u2019t, and how bird nests correspond to egg color. The researchers will now need a larger sample of eggshells to analyze.</p><p>But, once again, birds are living dinosaurs.

New market research shows that the cost of paying for TV has risen by 50 percent since 2010.<br></p><p>Leichtman Research Group published <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.leichtmanresearch.com/78-of-tv-households-subscribe-to-a-pay-tv-service/\" target=\"_blank\">a new report</a> on Wednesday based on a survey of 1,152 households around the United States. It found that the mean American household is paying about $107 every month for some form of pay-TV service<strong>s</strong> like cable or satellite. That\u2019s a big jump from its 2010 finding of an average monthly cable bill of $71.24. In 2010, <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2010/01/06/news/companies/cable_bill_cost_increase/\" target=\"_blank\">research firm Centris found</a> in its own study that the average cable bill was $75 each month and projected that it would rise five percent each year. The good news is that pace has slowed a bit in the last year and the average spend only went up by 1 percent. The bad news is we\u2019re spending more than $100 every month for frickin\u2019 TV.</p><div><div><div><p><small>Advertisement</small></p><div data-ad-unit=\"MOBILE_IN_POST\" data-targeting=\"{&quot;pos&quot;:&quot;mobile_inpost&quot;}\"></div><p></p></div></div></div><p>According to LRG, about 78 percent of households with a television are paying for TV in some way. That\u2019s down nine percent from 2008. It found that younger consumers were less likely to pay for cable and 32 percent of respondents who\u2019d moved in the last year have not activated a pay-TV service. Tracking people who have moved could indicate that there are many more subscribers that might cut the cord if faced with the decision of re-subscribing.</p><p>The researchers found that the top pay-TV providers that make up 95 percent of the market lost 415,000 video subscribers in the second quarter of 2018. The top six cable companies\u2019 subscriber counts dropped across the board. In contrast, cheaper streaming bundles from Sling TV and DirectTV Now added 383,000 subscribers.</p><div data-ad-unit=\"SPLASHYMID\" data-targeting=\"{&quot;pos&quot;:&quot;splashymid&quot;}\"></div><div></div><p>In other news on cable companies, the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/lazarus/la-fi-lazarus-spectrum-cable-rate-hike-20181030-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">Los Angeles Times</a> tried its damnedest to find out how much the cable boxes that are rented on a monthly basis to subscribers actually cost cable companies to purchase. Next month, Spectrum TV will raise its monthly rate for a set-top box to $7.50 from $6.99. Predictably, Spectrum did not want to say how much it pays for the boxes, and neither did Arris International, the world\u2019s largest supplier of set-top boxes. Charter, DirecTV, Cox Communications, and Comcast all declined to reveal their own cable box costs. Finally, some Wall Street analysts that track Arris told the Times that they would estimate the boxes go for \u201c$150 apiece and more advanced boxes for closer to $250.\u201d</p><div><div><div><p><small>Advertisement</small></p><div data-ad-unit=\"MOBILE_IN_POST\" data-targeting=\"{&quot;pos&quot;:&quot;mobile_inpost&quot;}\"></div><p></p></div></div></div><p>Why are all these prices going up at a time when the pay-TV industry faces stiff competition from dedicated streaming services like Netflix and skinny bundles from Sling? Shouldn\u2019t competition be driving prices down? It\u2019s a great question.

Hyundai and Kia have <a href=\"https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/2640\">laid out plans</a> to equip &quot;selected&quot; cars with solar panels on their roofs or hoods. They'll help charge batteries for <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/15/hyundai-kona-electric-ev-review/\">electric vehicles</a> and hybrids, but they'll also be useful for combustion-only vehicles. You won't have to settle for solar panels blocking your view of the sky above, either.</p>\n<p>While the first-gen solar roof will be limited to hybrids with conventional roofs, a second-wave semi-transparent roof will be available on cars (including combustion-only models) as part of a panoramic sunroof system. There's also a third-gen system in a pilot phase that will provide power from the roof and hood at the same time.</p>\n<p>It promises to be effective. Tthe first-gen model can charge 30 to 60 percent of a hybrid's battery per day depending on both the weather and the overall environment. While that's not spectacular, it could significantly reduce charging times and keep you from using gas on those days when you don't have chances to plug in.</p>\n<p>You won't see the first-gen solar tech until &quot;after 2019.&quot; With that said, it could become commonplace among automakers if it proves successful. It's a good selling point for cost-conscious and eco-friendly drivers, but it could also be alluring to companies struggling to meet fuel efficiency and emissions standards. They could put solar panels on enough vehicles to raise fuel economy figures without having to make dramatic changes to engines or the overall designs.</p>\n<p><strong>Source: </strong><a href=\"https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/2640\" target=\"_blank\">Hyundai</a></p>"}, "crawled": 1541063165543, "engagement": 362, "published": 1541062920000, "ampUrl": "https://www.engadget.com/amp/2018/11/01/hyundai-and-kia-solar-panel-cars/", "webfeeds": {"logo": "http://storage.googleapis.com/test-site-assets/4i-1vhCwmRRLfmB7ypTnMh-ZKSvsz6Rgf0lfR0WWb0w_ologo-14f041f5bd8", "relatedTarget": "browser", "relatedLayout": "card"}, "keywords": ["car", "cars", "electriccar", "electricvehicle", "ev", "gear", "green", "hyundai", "kia", "solarpanel", "transportation"], "alternate": [{"href": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/11/01/hyundai-and-kia-solar-panel-cars/", "type": "text/html"}], "memes": [{"label": "Hyundai Kia Veloster", "id": "topic/tech_en/meme/d7f3fe2c-ddd7-11e8-b87b-0a580a0c0305", "score": 0.42050559336545096}]}, {"id": "4i+1vhCwmRRLfmB7ypTnMh+ZKSvsz6Rgf0lfR0WWb0w=_166cdba950e:8fc698:4f2ca3e", "engagementRate": 0.82, "cdnAmpUrl": "https://www-engadget-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.engadget.com/amp/2018/11/01/ai-can-learn-language-the-way-children-do/", "origin": {"title": "Engadget", "streamId": "feed/http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml", "htmlUrl": "http://www.engadget.com"}, "title": "MIT-developed AI learns language like a child does", "visual": {"url": "none"}, "originId": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/11/01/ai-can-learn-language-the-way-children-do/", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/11/01/ai-can-learn-language-the-way-children-do/", "unread": true, "fingerprint": "8648b4a3", "summary": {"direction": "ltr", "content": "<img src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?crop=1600%2C1067%2C0%2C0&quality=85&format=jpg&resize=1600%2C1067&image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2018-10%2F500cbcc0-dd59-11e8-8f7f-5f17a1be0b52&client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&signature=ea136e5b05ab5846d5e7280993f8e84533eedc3c\"><p>When you teach language to AI systems, you typically use annotations that describe how words work. But that's not practical in many cases -- even if everybody agrees on those annotations, they often take a lot of time to produce and can still seem unnatural. MIT's solution? Have AI learn like a child. Its researchers have <a href=\"http://news.mit.edu/2018/machines-learn-language-human-interaction-1031\">developed</a> a parser that imitates kids' learning processes by observing scenes and making connections.</p>\n<p>The system studies captioned videos and learns to link words to objects and actions by determining the accuracy of a description. It turns the potential meanings into logical mathematical expressions, picking the expression that most closely represents what it thinks is going on. While the AI may start with a vast range of potential meanings and little idea as to what it's seeing, it will gradually whittle down the possibilities. Annotations can help speed the process, but the technology doesn't <em>need</em> annotations to learn.</p>\n<p>Crucially, the approach is flexible. As the system is observing its environment, it can learn based on how people actually speak, not just formal language. MIT envisions robots that could adapt to the linguistic habits of the people around it, even with sentence fragments and other signs of informal dialog.</p>\n<p>The childlike method could speed up the learning process and make AI that can handle uncommon languages that rarely get AI-friendly annotations. We'd add that it could produce more robots that need relatively little hand-holding. It could even help understand how children learn about the world.
